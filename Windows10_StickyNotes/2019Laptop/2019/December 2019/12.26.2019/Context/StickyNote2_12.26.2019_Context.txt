The dream section of the note that is nested within {} is about a dream. The first part was of a quickly dying laptop, MS-WORD and LibreOffice beig used, and accidentally saying the N word out loud out of anger and getting caught

The other parts of the note is about a purpose discovered for my new Christmas SD card, where 16 gigabytes will be allocated for drone video/image, but there is still a purpose needing to be found for the other 112 gigabytes
