Website plans for 1.4.2020
Get copy and pasting until you find a day you can do this

New content
Add in phrase tag page (6 separate, 1 all-in-one) there will be redirect links, but all related content should go on each page. Make sure to use the new CSS I made yesterday

Advertising update

Work on this description:
As a high school student who wanted to volunteer in a technical job suited for me, I was unable to. I won't let the same happen to my volunteers Waiving off community service hours for developers (soon to be all across America and other countries that require community service hours)

Developer log and idea board:
Bring snapshot dates up to January 4th 2020 (shouldn't take too long)

Other notes
No idea board update. 

Other updates
Begin preparation for testing more HTML5 tags
The go-to for phrase tag support is now there for SourceBase after this update, but the update won't come until I test more tags and features (like a dropdown for the navigation abr for when the display gets full)

Future website idea (don't add in yet)
Ad superswitch (turns on/off all ads without having to go through menus
